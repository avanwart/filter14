</ol>

<p>Documentation issues are also tracked at the <a href="https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues">jQuery Validation</a> issue tracker.
Pull Requests to improve the docs are welcome at the <a href="https://github.com/jzaefferer/validation-content">jQuery Validation docs</a> repository, though.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EMAIL VALIDATION</strong>. As of version 1.12.0 this plugin is using the same regular expression that the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address">HTML5 specification suggests for browsers to use</a>. We will follow their lead and use the same check. If you think the specification is wrong, please report the issue to them. If you have different requirements, consider <a href="http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/">using a custom method</a>.</p>
